# Anthony J. Wood's Early Code
Welcome to my early-years software collection.  Here you will find executable code, source code, magazine articles, notes, and rejection/acceptance letters I wrote or designed while in middle school to college. I created this repo mostly for myself and as an archive/backup, but a little bit for my friends and family.

[Summary Here](./index.md)

# PDP-11
In 8th grade I learned to code after school at the American School of the Hague (and some trips to the Computer Museum to use their Commodore PET)

# TRS-80
Back in Houston at the start of 9th grade I got [my TRS-80](aw-microcomputer-history.md), and while in high school I wrote the following programs.

# Commodore 64
Towards the end of high school I [purchased the super-cool Commodore 64](./aw-microcomputer-history.md) and wrote the following.

   - Lunar Lander [ReadMe](./C64/lunar-lander/readme.md) | [Article PDF with Source](./C64/lunar-lander/ahoy-april-1984-lunar-lander.pdf)

# Amiga
I purchased my Commodore Amiga in late 1985 with a loan from my parents, during my junior year of college.

# Windows
These windows programs aren't technically "early".  The Windows Maze is a port with enhancements of the maze I wrote for the Amiga.  And the Emulators and BASIC were written in part to run my early software on windows.

   - [Windows amaze](./windows/amaze/)
   - [AW Basic](./windows/awbasic/)
   - [Classic Basic Games](./windows/basic-classics/ReadMe.txt)
   - [TRS-80 Emulator](./windows/trs-80-emulator/)

# macromedia flash
I've been a fan of Space Invaders since I first played it at the "West World" arcade in the Hague. I hand wrote a [simple version](./pdp-11/space-invaders/space-invaders-hand-code-cbm-pet-1978-composite.jpg) for the PET, then partially completed an [Amiga Implementation](./amiga/space-invaders-unfinished/).  I wrote this Flash version to learn flash programming.  Its the only flash software I ever wrote, and IIRC it mostly worked.
