# A Brief History of Anthony's Microcomputers

## PDP-11 American School of the Hague, Netherlands
For 8th grade (age 12/13, 1978/79) we moved from Houston to the Hague, Netherlands for a year or so.  While at the American Middle School of the Hague  I taught myself to program in the BASIC computer language.  I would go to the "computer museum" in downtown Hague via the tram, and use the time sharing terminals and the Commodore PETs they had there for the public.  But mostly, I would stay after school and use the single and old [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11), which they named "Merlin".  The only computer class the school offered was "make Melvin draw" during which you would use punch cards to create ASCI art. I made [a smurf](./pdp-11/make-melvin-draw-smurf-result.jpg) 

The primary program I wrote using the PDP-11, its teletype (with a paper tape reader-writer), and "EduSystem BASIC" was "Battle Star Galactica".  I modeled this after the popular Star Trek game of the day (you can play this Star Trek game in my classic-games collection in this repo).

## TRS-80 Alief, Houston, Texas
When we returned to Houston from the Hague I worked out a deal with my dad to buy one of the new 'microcomputers'.  I would pay half (cutting neighbors grass), and he would pay half.   He found two used ones at work for sale -- an Apple II and a TRS-80.  I am not sure why, but I picked the [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80).  During high school I went through phases where I programmed, and when I didn't.  Initially my TRS-80 did not have floppy disk drives - software was saved to cassette tape.  At some point, my dad got me floppy disk drives and a printer!  Also at one point I 'blew up' my TRS-80 while attaching a sound board I designed (which obviously didn't work correctly.)  That broken TRS-80 was expensive to fix and set me back a while.  During this time I also started my first 'company' - [AW Software](./awsoftware/readme.md).

## Commodore 64, Alief, Houston, Texas
While in high school I went to a TRS-80 microcomputer user group meeting where they demoed a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) running PacMan.  It was amazing, with color graphics and games that looked as good as those in the arcades.   I soon purchased a C-64 as well as the 1541 disk drive from toys-r-us (more grass cutting money, and perhaps some from my Burger King and chuck-e-cheese jobs).  I wrote BASIC and 6502 software.  I also managed to sell some of my software to computer magazines (which back then would publish software in the magazine.)

## Commodore Amiga, College Station, Texas
While attending Texas A&M University I purchased an [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) in about 1985 from MicroSearch in Houston.  It was very expensive, and I got a loan from my parents to pay for it.  The Amiga had revolutionary graphics and sound for the time.  As well as programming, I was interested in electronics spent a lot of time learning to design and build digital circuits while in high school.  In college I designed a "Sound Sampler" (aka a Sound Digitizer).   The Amiga and the Macintosh were the first computers to have digital audio playback.  Both were 8 bit.  The Mac was mono and the Amiga was stereo.  Neither had a way to record audio.  I designed an 8 bit stereo sound sampler and started selling it as [Perfect Sound](./amiga/perfect-sound/readme.md), which was the start of my first successful company - SunRize Industries.

The Amiga is where I learned multi-tasking programming as well as GUI design and programming.  The Amiga OS used the awesome [Exec kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(Amiga)) written by my hero [Carl Sassenrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sassenrath).

## IBM PC
We have pretty much reached the end of my formative programming years.  With Perfect Sound and the start of SunRize Industries, you could say I transition from a hobbyist to a professional.   At some point in the late 80's I got my first IBM PC clone.  I mostly used it for word processing, but in the early 90's I started to write the occasional windows software, mostly as hobby projects.  I wrote a TRS-80 emulator, which is included here.
