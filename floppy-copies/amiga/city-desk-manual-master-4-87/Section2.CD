Getting Started
[roman 10;pl;fj]


Getting Started

.hi=4
a) Turn on your Amiga computer. The switch is normally located on the left side.
b) Insert the Kickstart disk into the internal drive (DF0:)
c) Make sure Cƒiƒtƒyƒ ƒDƒeƒsƒkƒ is write-protected. If you can see through the notch located in the upper right corner of the disk then the disk is write-protected, otherwise slide the write-protect tab up. This will protect your master disk from being overwritten or erased while you make your backup copy.
c) Remove Kickstart and insert the C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ disk (place this disk instead of the Workbench disk when the Amiga prompts you for it).
d) Now let's make a backup of C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ to secure the original disk.
.hi=0
.ce=y

For all subsequent runs, use the CƒOƒPƒYƒ not the original disk!
.ce=n


Be Sure to Backup!

C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ may be backed up in two ways: from Workbench or from the CLI.  The steps below outline how to backup C‚i‚t‚y‚ D‚e‚s‚k‚ from Workbench only. For those of you who prefer using CLI for backing up disks, please refer to the A„m„i„g„a„D„O„S„ „U„s„e„r„'„s„ „M„a„n„u„a„l„   for correct syntax and information about the DiskCopy utility program.

If you only have a single disk drive, use the following procedure to make the backup.
.hi=8
        step 1. Remove C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ from the internal drive and insert a blank disk in its place. (Note: the internal drive is named DF0:)
        step 2. You will see two icons: the C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ icon and the blank disk icon (this icon is labeled DF0:BAD.)
        step 3. Using the mouse, point to the C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ icon.                             
        step 4. Holding down the LEFT mouse button, drag the  C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ icon so that it is on top of the blank disk icon.
        step 5. Follow the system requests. You will be swapping disks several times. At the system prompts, select "CONTINUE" by clicking the left mouse button.
        step 6. You should now have a working copy of C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚.‚ 
        step 7. Write protect your C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ copy.

Backing up disks on a two drive system is much simpler. The steps are outlined below.
.hi=8
         step 1. Make sure that C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ is placed in the internal drive (or DF0:)
         step 2. Insert a blank disk in the external drive (or DF1:). This icon is labeled "DF1:BAD." You do not need to format the blank disk prior to copying.
         step 3. Holding down the LEFT mouse button, drag the C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ icon and place it on top of the blank disk icon.
         step 4. Follow the system requests. Click the "CONTINUE" box when you are ready
         step 5. You should now have a working backup of C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚.‚
        step 6. Write protect your backup copy.
.hi=0

.ce=y
Remember to always use the backup copy for subsequent runs,
NOT the original.
.ce=n


Running City Desk

   C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ may be loaded to run in two ways: from the CLI or from Workbench. This manual describes the latter method only. After loading Kickstart, the Amiga will prompt you to enter the Workbench disk. At this point insert C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ in the internal drive instead of the Workbench disk.
   Point to the C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ icon and double click the left mouse button to  open its window. Now point to the icon that reads "CITY DESK"  and double click the left mouse button. C‚i‚t‚y‚ ‚D‚e‚s‚k‚ will present you with three windows. Now let's get started with an introduction to desktop publishing and typesetting concepts.
