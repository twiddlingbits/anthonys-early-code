**
** these are the specifications for the diagnostic area.  If the Diagnostic
** Address Valid bit is set in the Board Type byte (the first byte in
** expansion space) then the Diag Init vector contains a valid offset.
**
** The Diag Init vector is actually a word offset from the base of the
** board.  The resulting address points to the base of the DiagArea
** structure.  The structure may be physically implemented either four,
** eight, or sixteen bits wide.  The code will be copied out into
** ram first before being called.
**
** The da_Size field, and both code offsets (da_DiagPoint and da_BootPoint)
** are offsets from the diag area AFTER it has been copied into ram, and
** "de-nibbleized" (if needed).  Inotherwords, the size is the size of
** the actual information, not how much address space is required to
** store it.
**
** All bits are encoded with uninverted logic (e.g. 5 volts on the bus
** is a logic one).
**
** If your board is to make use of the boot facility then it must leave
** its config area available even after it has been configured.  Your
** boot vector will be called AFTER your board's final address has been
** set.
