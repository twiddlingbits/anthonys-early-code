Dear Amiga Dealer,


Soon you will be seeing ads for our latest product, Studio Magic,  a digital sound studio for the Amiga.  With Studio Magic, you can create spectacular sound effects, IFF instruments, and even musical scores.  To learn more about Studio Magic, take a look at  the flyer I have enclosed, "Rediscover Sound."

Studio Magic is the perfect companion for our Perfect Sound audio digitizer.  In fact, with the last group of update letters we mailed to Perfect Sound owners, we enclosed a Studio Magic flyer.  The response was very good, and we expect a strong demand for Studio Magic. Not only Perfect Sound owners, but anyone with a sound sampler or an interest in music or digital sound will love Studio Magic.

Studio Magic has a suggested retail price of $99.95, and will be shipping on September 25, 1987.  Dealer discounts start at 40% and move up to 50% for larger orders.  We are taking orders now, so give us a call today.

As well as Studio Magic, we are working on several other exciting products. The Amiga 500 version of Perfect Sound is in production and should be available soon.  Also, our most promising product to date will be available in October... a real time video digitizer!

Soon we will be sending you more information on our video digitizer, but here's something for starters:  the price will be lower than any of our competitors, in the $200 to $250 range (suggested retail.)  And, as always our dealer discounts are competitive.

Don't forget, Studio Magic will be shipping in less than one week.



Sincerely,



Anthony J. Wood
President
