Section 4
Let's Create a Sample Page



This tutorial will walk you through the steps necessary to create a sample page.  In fact, we will create this page-- the one you are reading now.  The necessary files are included as text and graphic files on your City Desk master disk.   City Desk  is very powerful and takes up almost all of the program disk.   For this reason, it was necessary to keep  text files to a minimum to conserve space on the program disk for clip art.  This tutorial will allow you to use a basic Amiga System with at least 512K RAM.  It is important to realize that graphics require a large amount of memory.  If you plan to use a lot of graphics in your City Desk documents we suggest you acquire extra RAM for your system.  We have included a simple graphic to use in this tutorial.  Experiment with your own or some of the clip art provided to get an idea of the limitations of your available memory.  We have provided a section of high-res clip art for users with memory expansion.

Before you begin, you should familiarize yourself with City Desk by reading Section 3, the Overview Section.
