            A Guide to Purchasing a Microcomputer     The task of buying a microcomputer, whether for business or home use, is becoming increasingly complex as time progresses.  In 1979, the consumer's options were limited to two computers--the Apple or TRS-80.  Now, however, hundreds of microcomputers are offered to the buyer.  It is often hard for the consumer to decide which computer is "the best."  The purpose of this article is to give you some background on what makes up a computer system, what to look for when buying a computer, and what types of microcomputers are available today.  Hopefully, this will allow you to walk into a computer store with the ability to understand what the salesperson is talking about, and therefore, to make a more objective and intelligent decision.     A computer is basicly composed of three seperate parts--the CPU, memory, and periphials.  The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the "thinking" part of the computer.  It does calculations, makes decisions, and is the workhorse of the computer.  In a microcomputer, the CPU is synonymous to the microprocessor.  Manufacturers will proudly advertise the type of microprocessor their computer uses; however, although the type of microprocessor is important, it is only one of many things to look at when purchasing a microcomputer.  A well designed computer with an out dated microprocessor is often better than a poorly designed computer with a state of the art microprocessor.  An important difference exists between two major types of microprocessors, the  8 bit and 16 bit microprocessors.  A bit is a computer term that refers to a unit of information; data is stored inside a computer as bits. The 8 bit microprocessors can process information 8 bits at a time while 16 bit microprocessors handle data 16 bits at a time.  Generally, 16 bit microprocessors are faster than 8 bit ones.  16 bit microprocessors have other advantages too technical to go into here.     While the microprocessor processes data, the memory stores data.  Two different types of memory are present in most microcomputer systems--RAM and ROM.  RAM (Random Access Memory) is where your programs and data are stored.  ROM (Read Only Memory) is where the computer remembers its own internal system programs.  You cannot store your personal data in ROM, only in RAM.  A major difference between the two is that the computer forgets everything in RAM once the computer is turned off.  It does remember, however, everything in ROM.  You cannot alter the ROM memory while you can change data stored in RAM.  Since your programs and data are stored in RAM, the more you have the better.  The unit for measuring memory is a K, where one K equals 1024 bytes of memory.  A byte is approximatly the amount of memory needed to remember one letter.  Therefore, a computer with 16K of RAM has 16X1024 bytes, or the ability to remember 16,384 letters of text.     Besides memory and the CPU, the third and perhaps most important component of a computer system is the periphials.  A periphial is anything that interfaces with the computer to perform a function.  For example, a keyboard allows you to enter data into the computer.  The video display allows data to be outputed from the computer.  Most periphials are input/output devices--things for getting information into and out of the computer.  Many periphials are also devices designed to store large amounts of data permanently.     Since programs and data are lost when the computer is turned off, a method must exist to permenantly store data and programs.  A very common and cheap way to do this is with a cassette tape.  Almost all microcomputers available today provide an interface to connect to a tape recorder.  The major disadvantage to tapes is their speed--they are slow.  A long program can take ten minutes to save or load from a tape.  When you look at a computer, find the baud rate for saving and loading to tape.  This is a measurment of the rate data is transfered to tape.  The higher this number, the better.  For instance, 500 baud is slow, 1000 baud is good, and 1500 baud is great.     If you do not wish to deal with the hassle of tape, you might want to consider buying a floppy disk drive, another device for storing programs and data.  The same program that took ten minutes to save or load on tape, might take only four seconds on a disk drive.  A disk is a piece of round magnetic material enclosed in a square plastic case.  The disk drive records data on the disk, similarly to a tape recorder, but it is much faster since the disk spins at 360 RPMs and is accessed like a record player.     After deciding whether to use tape or disk to store data, you will be faced with the option of buying a printer.  Two basic types of printers exist--the letter quality printer, sometimes called a daisy wheel, and the dot matrix printer.  A letter quality printer, the most expensive type, produces print equal in quality to a typewriter.  It is generaly only needed for a business enviroment.  The dot matrix printers are faster and cheaper than letter quality printers, but the print they produce is formed by dots, and therefore it is not as sharp as letter quality print.     When you buy a microcomputer, whether for business or home, there are certian items you should look for.  First, the place you purchase your computer is important.   With the increasing popularity of mircrocomputers, many department and toy stores are starting to carry computers; their prices are often cheaper than a store specializing in computer equipment. However, there are several pitfalls to buying computers from department and toy stores, the formost being their inability to offer you support.  If you have questions concerning your computer (which you will), the sales personel at a toy store will be of little help.  These types of stores cannot service your computer either, if it breaks.  Therefore, it is often better to buy your microcomputer from a store specializing in microcomputer equipment.     Another important factor to consider when buying a computer is the services offered by the manufacturer.  Do they have a toll free number to call for help when you have questions?  Do they have a large network of service outlets?  Do they offer a guarantee with the option to purchase a service contract?  If the anwser to these questions is yes, you will be saved many problems when you start using your microcomputer.     Before buying a computer, find out how much software--the programs that make a computer work--is available for it.  Some good computers are not worth buying because no programs are available for them.  The TRS-80 and Apple computer systems probobly have the most software available.  This is a major reason why they are so popular.     Some more things to check before buying a microcomputer are the quality of the keyboard, video output, and manual.  Many good computers are ruined by a bad keyboard.  The keyboard should look like a type writer keyboard.  It should not be too small, made of touch sensative plastic, or made of "chicklet" type buttons.  A good video display is sharp, and has at least 40 letters on a line.  If you want to use the computer for word processing, the video should display 80 characters on a line. If you want to play arcade style games with your microcomputer, compare the resolutions of the graphics--the size of the smallest dots on the screen that make up the pictues.  Find out how many colors can be displayed at the same time, and if you are going to hook up the picture to your TV, have the dealer demonstrate the video on a TV, not on a monitor.  The quality of the display is much better on a monitor than a TV set--monitors are specialy made to display computer video output.     After checking the video, be sure to examine the manuals that come with the computer.  You should get a USER'S GUIDE and a REFERENCE manual.  Both should be well organized and have a large index.  The user's guide should tell the computer illiterate how to use the computer--turn it on, etc.  The reference manual should be a technical explanation of the functions of the microcomputer.  Try to find out how well these books are written before you buy the computer.     If you are buying a microcomputer for business use, check on how fast the computer is, and whether or not a hard disk is available.  Although the computer might seem fast in the store, it could be significanty slower when you try to sort large amounts of data.  If your computer is going to need to access large amounts of data, a hard disk drive might be needed.  A hard disk stores large amounts of data with very fast access to the data.  As much data can be stored on one hard disk as on fourty or fifty floppy disks     Microcomputers come in a wide range of prices, from $49 to $10,000.  Basicly, you get what you pay for.  The following computers--Timex sinclair, Vic-20, Commodore 64, TRS-80 model 4, and Lisa--are some examples of what is available in each price range.     The timex computer is small, and can be bought for under $50.  The keyboard is terrible, the screen is bad, and it comes with a minimum of memory.  Some people claim it is a good computer to learn about computers on, a claim that may have had some merit.  Now, however, the Vic-20 is available for $89, and it is 100 times better than the timex.     The Commodore 64 is probably the best deal for the money if you want a cheap but expandable home computer.  At $199, the Commodore 64 offers excellent grapics, 64K of RAM, and a nice keyboard.  However, it does have some bad points.  The quality control by Commodore is poor; many units shipped to stores do not work.  One salseperson complained that 1 out of 4 computers is defective.     The TRS-80 model 4 would make a nice home or business computer at $999 for the basic computer or $1700 for a system with 64K and two disk drives.  The model 4 is a well designed and well supported computer.  Its major disavantage, however, is its lack of good graphics.  Many arcade games are available for the model 4, but they are not nearly as nice as the ones for the Commodore 64 or Vic 20.     The Lisa, by Apple computers, is a top of the line microcomputer for business users.  At $10,000, however, it is too expensive for many people.  It offers nice graphics, a fast 16 bit microprocessor, 80 column display, and good support.  When you buy the system, most of the software you will ever need is provided.  The Lisa promises to be a popular computer.     It is a dificult job to determine which computer is best for you.  There is probably no right anwser.  What ever computer you buy, make sure it is well supported.  Be sure you can buy programs and components for it.  Be sure you can have it fixed if it breaks, and talk to people who have one before you buy a brand of computer. à  	 >6 M	  Pe                                                                                                
