# Anthony's Early Software Code
I recently spent some time recovering my old programs.  I created this small web site to highlight some of the pieces I am most proud of for my friends, family, and curious on lookers.

# C64 Ahoy! Magazine Articles
In the mid 80's computer magazines were popular that published programs and games.   Readers would literally type the program in.  After a couple years of [being rejected](./scans/1981-7-20-creative-computing-tomb.jpg), I was [able to sell](./scans/1984-6-15-ahoy-composite.jpg) five while in high school. Here are four of the articles scanned from Ahoy! Magazine.

   - [Space Hunt](./C64/space-hunt/space-hunt-ahoy-april-1985.pdf)

# Code Highlights
Here are a few of my earliest programs that I remember fondly.
   - [Perfect Sound](./amiga/perfect-sound/readme.md) - Perfect Sound was top selling 8-bit sound sampler for the Amiga computer that I developed while a Junior in college in 1986.  I designed the hardware, wrote the software, wrote the manual, and got people to sell it.
   - [Lunar Lander](./C64/lunar-lander/readme.md) - A Commodore 64 game I sold while a senior in high school.  The same one in the above article.  But here you will find screen shots and code.
   - [Germany 1942](./TRS-80/germany-1942/readme.md) - Text Adventure written in an [adventure language I created](./TRS-80/micro-adventure-language/readme.md), for TRS-80.  I worked on my adventure language for 2 or 3 years off and on while in high school.  The game Germany 1942 was done with the final version of the adventure language when I was a senior.  You can play this game on Windows, its packaged with the TRS-80 emulator download below.
   - [Boot n Copy](./TRS-80/boot-n-copy/readme.md) - replaced the boot sector on a TRS-80 floppy disk.
   - [Quest-for-fire](./TRS-80/quest-for-fire/readme.md) - a text adventure where I honed my z-80 assembly skills.
   - [Battle Star Galactica](./pdp-11/battlestar-galactica.jpg) - This is a BASIC game I wrote in 8th grade using our school's PDP-11 minicomputer. Also see [all of my PDP-11 BASIC code](./pdp-11/readme.md). You can play this game, its packaged with my BASIC for windows download below.

# Computer Emulators
Modern computers can emulate the hardware and software of old microcomputers from the 1980s and 1990s.  You can use these emulators to run my software on your laptop.  The TRS-80 emulator and my BASIC interpreter are easy to download here and use since I wrote it and it is self contained. But it only runs on Windows.   The Amiga and C-64 emulators probably require you to purchase the emulator.  The actual emulators are free open source, but the original ROMs and operating system are not.  You need to buy and download the emulator, then load the appropriate disk image from [my git hub repo](https://github.com/ajwood1965/anthony-code-history/#readme).
   - [My TRS-80 Emulator for Windows](./windows/trs-80-emulator/AWSoftware.exe) comes preloaded with some of my TRS-80 Software.
   - [My BASIC for Windows](./windows/basic-classics/classic-basic-games-v1.0.zip) comes preloaded with some of my software (including Battle Star Galactica) as well as other examples of text games of the time.
   - A third party [Amiga Emulator](https://www.amigaforever.com/) can be used to run my Amiga software
   - A third party [Commodore 64](https://www.c64forever.com/) Emulator can be used to run my C-64 Software
