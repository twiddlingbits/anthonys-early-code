The "smart" part of Sterm 64 is its ability to capture text and store it on disk, its built in "dos wedge," its ability to print text on your printer, to transfer file between computers, and other features.     If you are new to the world of communications, you should read this manual in its entirety; however, if you understand the concepts of "downloading" and "uploading" fairly well, you might want to skip the next section.File Transfer, an Overview.     File transfer--the act of sending a file (or program) from your computer to another computer by phone--is possible severaly ways.  Each of these different ways is called a different "protocol."    To downloading, the act of recieving a program or disk file over the phone, sterm supportes three potocols:  Xmodem, Image, and text.  These same protocols are also available for uploading, the proccess of sending a program over the phone to another computer.     The most basic way to receive a program (download) is to use your capture buffer.  At your command, Sterm can open its buffer.  Until the buffer is closed, all text received will be stored in memory.  After you close the buffer, this saved information can be stored on disk.     If you use this method to receive a BASIC program, there are two possibilities:  Either the program will be straight text (it will look like it does when you type it in) or it will be in image form.     Image format can be recogonized becaues it looks something like this::18000000040043211FCED57E94A02B...If the program is in Image form, it must be converted back to the original program.  Sterm will do this for you automaticly when it is saved to disk (just answer the correct question with "i" for image--see the "save command" below.)    If data you receive in your buffer looks like a basic program, you can specify this when you save the program on disk (see the save command.)     Another method of file transfer, besides using your capture buffer, is the Xmodem protocol.  This protocol--compatible with the CP/M "modem" protocol, is the best method to use in many cases.  It is much faster than the image protocol (2+ times faster,) and it is more reliable.For an explanation of how xmodem works, see the xmodem command belowSTERM COMMANDS     As soon as you run Sterm, it puts you in "terminal mode." In other words, your computer is acting just like a terminal.  You can execute various commands by holding down the "commodore key" (bottom left of your keyboard) and pressing a letter simultaneously.  The list of possible commands follows:Display and alter string settings (A)     This command allows you to define passwords, or any string of up to 39 letters or symbols.  After a string has been defined, you can send the entire string by pressing the control key, and that string's number in the terminal mode.  If you do not wish to define a string, press return.    If the first character of the defined string is a backslash (/), the string will be sent at a slow rate of speed. This is for computers that can not receive at full speed.    You can embed a return into the string by pressing the commodore key and the English pound sign (upper right corner of your keyboard.) This will cause a graphics character to display, but when the string is sent over the modem, a return will be sent.Close buffer (C)     This command causes your buffer to close.  Text being displayed is not being stored now.Disk command (D)     This allows you to send any valid disk command to your disk drive similar to the "dos wedge."  You may read the status line by pressing return instead of entering a disk command.  This should be done if the red light starts to blink on your disk drive.Half/full duplex toggle (H)     This command switches back and forth between half and full duplex.  Half duplex has the effect of echoing to the screen anything you type.  Normal terminal operation is usualy in full duplex.Dial a number (I)     This command is for the commodore auto modem 1650.  At the prompt "enter number to dial?", you have two options.  If the first character you enter is a pound sign (#), the following digits will be dialed.  If, however, you just enter a number, the appropriate defined numbers will be dialed.  For example:#5551984 <return>  would cause the number "5551984" to be dialed.0253  <return>  would cause the numbers stored at 0,2,5, and 3 to be dialed (see auto dial menu).     You can also enter "0123r" to have the computer keep dialing defined numbers 0,1,2, and 3 until one answers.     If a "p" is inserted in a defined number, or in the number after a "#", a pause will occur.     Remember, before you dial a number, you must switch the data switch on your modem from "T" to "D".Auto dial menu (J)     This is similar to the define strings menu, but it allows you to define phone numbers.  These phone numbers are sent with the "I" command (see above.) Load Buffer (L)     This command will load a program or sequentual file into your buffer.  Once  you have loaded a file, you can upload it with the "U" command.     Note that any program file will be automaticlly converted into image format.Open buffer (O)     This will open your buffer so that text you are seeing is being stored in memory.  Once you have received the desired text, you can close the buffer and save it to disk.     It should be noted that your buffer can be automaticly opened and closed by the computer you are connected to.  If a control R is received, your buffer will open.  If a control T is received, the buffer will close.Print buffer (P)     This will print your buffer to a commodore printer. To halt the printing hold down run/stop.  If you have the printer disconnected, the buffer will print on the screen.Define RS232 settings (R)     This allows you to redefine the settings of the rs232, such as word length, parity, or stop bits.  Note that baud rated can not be defined--this is because sterm is designed for 300 baud modems.     You must find out from the computer you want to connect to what switch settings to use, however, 7 bit word, 1 stop bit, and "space transmitted" is common.     If you get a garbaled display while hooked up to a computer, this is often a sign that you have the wrong settings defined.     Note that the defined rs232 settings are saved with the "write default file (W)" command  (see below).Save Buffer (S)     This command will save the buffer to disk, and it will convert different formats at the same time.  After you enter the save command, you will be asked whether it is to be saved as a sequential or program file.  In most cases, if the buffer contains just text that you wanted to remember, it should be put in a sequential file (this may depend on your word processor, though.)  If the buffer contains a program in image or basic form, then it should be saved as a program file.     If the buffer is to be saved as a program file, then you have one more question to answer.  You must specify whether the buffer is in image format, or basic format.  Basic format refers to a basic program that looks normal.Upload Buffer (U)     This command will send the buffer contents (usually you need to Load the buffer--L command) to the computer on the other end of the phone.  You must enter transmission speed--0 being the fastest, and 9 the slowest.  Next you can specify a prompt character.  When you upload to a host computer, often it will want you to wait after each line of data until it is ready for the next line of data.  When the receiving computer is ready to continue, it will send a prompt character (commonly a > is used.)  When sterm receives this prompt character, it wil send the next line of data.     Sterm allows you to enter a prompt character, or enter return if the upload is not to wait for prompt charaters.     Press run/stop to quit the upload.Write default file (W)     If you use this command, the file "default" will be created on your disk,  This file contains the defined strings, phone numbers, rs232 settings, and boarder colors.     When sterm is first ran, it searches for this file.  If the file is found, the saved settings are loaded automaticlly      You should be sure to use this command after you change any settings you want to make permenant.Change boarder colors (Z)     This will allow you to change the boarder color, background color, and cursor color.    When you are asked for a color number, enter a number from the table on page 139 (appenix G) in the commondore 64 user's guide.Xmodem (X)      Xmodem is a method for sending or receiving programs over the phone with someone else who uses xmodem.  Xmodem was developed by Ward Christianson, and is compatible with CP/M modem protocol.     After selecting this command, you must specify whether you are the sender or receiver.     Next you must specify the file name of the disk file to send or receive.  The sending filename does not have to be the same as the receiving filename.     Finally, you specify whether the filename refers to a sequential file or a program file.     After you have entered all this information, the file transfer will take place.  If you are connected to another commodore 64, one of you must be in answer mode. It does not matter which.     While the file transfer is going on, the block being sent will be displayed.  Each block is 128 bytes long--this is not the same as a block in your disk directory.  A block shown when you do a disk directory is 256 bytes long--twice as large as an xmodem block.     If there is an error when a block is tansmitted, it will be retransmitted.  You can tell this because the message "sending block # ..." will appear twice, or several times, depending on how many times the block must be retransmitted.     Print disk directory ($)     You can display a directory of your disk by pressing the $ key and the commodore key.  To slow the listing press control, to pause the listing, press run/stop.     Open and Close receivers buffer (F5 and F7)      These function keys, F5 and F7, actually send a control R and control T respectively.  The effect, if you are connected to another smart terminal, is to open and close their buffer. This is useful if you are sending a text file or image file to a friend, and are using their capture buffer.  You can open and close his buffer from your terminal.MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES     Sterm 64 uses a bell for alerting you to certain functions. For example, after your buffer is closed, the bell rings to alert you that the download is over.  Also, when you are repeatedly dialing a number, the bell will ring when the call is answered.  The "bell" is created with the C64 sound chip--you should turn up the volume on your monitor or TV if you wish to hear it. à    >6 M  P                                                                                
