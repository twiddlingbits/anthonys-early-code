1.0  TERMINAL MENU     A smart terminal is for communicating with other hosts, that is an external computer.  The terminal menu alows you to alter the parameters that govern the actions of the smart terminal.  Corect use of these options should allow the use of the Compac smart terminal with most hosts.  Other parameters are controled by direct comands from the terminal mode.  All of these options are explained in detail below.1.1  Half/Full Duplex     After selecting "1", you must select "T" to alternate between half and full duplex or <ENTER> to leave the current state unaffected.  The terminal program often refers to a <C/R>.  This is short for "carrige return"--the same thing as <ENTER>.     In full duplex (the most common mode) all incoming data is displayed on the screen, and all outgoing data (eg. keys pressed) is transmited without being displayed on the screen. Normaly the host would echo this data back to your screen.  In half duplex, incoming data is displayed on the screen, and all outgoing data is transmited as well as displayed on the screen.Uses:  When typing to another terminal & not a host, it  often helpful to use half duplex so you can see what you are typing1.2  Configure Uart     After pressing "2", respond to the prompts with a new value or <ENTER> to leave the current value unchanged.Choose from the following valid responses:Baud: 110,150,300,600,1200,2400,4800,9600,Word Length: 5,6,7,8 bitsStop Bits: 1,2Parity: NONE, EVEN, ODD, N, E, O     If no default is suplyed for these values (see the defalt section, sec 3.0), then the sense switches will be used on a model I, or whatever is recieved from the equivelent locations on a model III. Uses:  Hosts often require different RC-232c settings. Find out from the host you are using which values to use.  Many hosts use 300 Baud, 7 bit word, 1 stop bit, with no parity.1.3  Save/Load Defined Keys     This option saves and loads to/from disk the values specivied in options 6 & 7.  These values are automaticly saved by the default option, so this command need only  be used if you want to define more keys than there are keys to define.     If this is the case then follow this procedure:  Define as many keys as you can then save them.  You can then re-define the keys and save the new keys under a different filename.  Just load in the Keys as you need them.                Uses:  See preceding paragraph.1.4  Save/Load Translation Tables     This option saves & loads the tables defined with option 5.                 Uses:  If you change the translation table                         values, use this option, and specify                         the filename you used under the                         default option.1.5  Define Translation Tables     A translation table is a table of 256 locations.  When a charachter goes to the video or printer, its ascii value is changed to the value entered in the translation table at the location equal to the ascii value of the character.  For example, supose we wanted to change all the "A"'s being printed  out to the screen to "B"'s.  Just change the value in the video translation table at location 64 from 64 ("A") to 65 ("B").  This example isn't of much use, but it does show how the translation table works.  The purpose of a translation table is to zero out charachters you don't want the video or printer to recieve.  For example, location 14 is zero'd out on the video translation table because it is the code to turn on the cursor.  Compac keeps its own cursor.     In response to the prompt "Enter value or range", enter either a single value, or a low and a high value seperated by commas. Example: 0,35  will display the values 0 to 35.1.6  Define Keys as Bytes     Each letter on the Keyboard can be defined as an ascii value between 1 and 255.  To trasmit the defined value, press <CLEAR> and <LETTER>. Uses:  This feature is useful for sending charachters that are not on the TRS-80 Key board.  Some computers require a delete (127) instead of a backspace (8).  To send a del, define a key as 127.  Then, to send the del, press the <CLEAR> and the defined <KEY> simutaniously.1.7  Define Keys as Strings     The numbers 0-9 can be defined as a strings.  The string must not be over 62 charachters long.  If a "/" is the first character in the string, the terminal program will pause slighly between sending each character in the string. This is to allow some hosts to accept data when they wouldn't be able to recieve it at the fastist possible rate.  To send a defined key press <CLEAR> and <NUMBER>.  To enter the <ENTER> key in a string, press <SHIFT> and <UP-ARROW>. Uses:  This is a good place to store passwords.  You can log on to BBS's or hosts by just pressing two keys after you have defined a key as a password.1.8  Define Poll String     A poll string is a short meassage that the smart terminal program will automaticly send when it recieves 5 cnt-E's. When the terminal program recieves 5 cnt-E's it will print <POLL> in the upper left corner of the screen and send the poll meassage defined under this option.  The only time you need to change the poll string is if you want to download in DFT(tm) from a BBS that requires a DFT poll. In this case, any string who's first 3 letter are "DFT" will probably work. (see file transfer for more on DFT(tm)).1.9  Enter Terminal Mode     This option puts you in the terminal mode, ready to use your modem. 1.A  Execute a DOS command     This option alows NEWDOS or DOSPLUS users to execute a DOS command from the terminal menu.  If you don't have NEWDOS or DOSPLUS then this command will execute a DOS command but will not return to the terminal menu. You must specify NEWDOS or DOSPLUS in the default section for this command to work properly.1.B  Exit to Main Menu     This option returns to the main menu.2.0  TERMINAL MODE     Once in the terminal mode, the computer is monitering the RC-232c port; you can now call a host computer.  The smart terminal can do certian functions as well as the comands in the terminal menu.  To use one of these commands, press <SHIFT> + <CLEAR> + <Comand letter> at the same time.  Each command is explained below.2.1  OPEN BUFFER  (O)     The buffer is an area in memory that is used to store data as it is recieved by the smart terminal; however, data will only be place in the buffer if it is open.  This can occur two ways.  Either you can manualy open the buffer by using the "O" command, or the buffer will automaticly open if an ascii 18 is recieved. USES:  Asume you are reading the instructions to a game.  It would be helpful if you could save them for furure reference. To do this, open the buffer at the begining of the text and close the buffer when you are finished.  Then, save them to disk with the "F" command.2.2  CLOSE BUFFER  (C)      Use this command to close the buffer.  The buffer can also be close automaticly by the host computer by sending an ascii 20 (see open buffer).2.3  SAVE BUFFER  (F)     This comand saves the current buffer contents to disk.  When asked "Convert buffer contents to binary?" respond with either "Y" or "N". If you answer no, the buffer will be saved as it is with no changes; however, if you answer yes, the smart terminal will asume that the buffer is in a hexadecimal format and the data will be changed to a binary repisentation before as it is saved. USES:  The ability to convert data to binary is used for downloading machine language files.  See sec 2.10 below.2.4  LOAD BUFFER  (G)     The "G" command loads a disk file into the buffer.  Answer the prompt "Convert file to ascii?" with either "Y" or "N".  If you answer no, the file will be load into the buffer with no changes; however, if you respond yes, the file will be asume to be in machine language (or other non-text file), and each byte will be changed into a two byte hexadecimal number as it is saved in the buffer. USES:  The ability to convert data to hexadecimal is useful for upoading machine language files.  See sec 2.5 below.2.5  UPLOAD BUFFER  (U)     This command sends the buffer contents to the host computer.  Answer the question "Wait for a prompt character?" with either "Y" or "N".  If the answer is yes, then before sending each line of data from the buffer, the smart terminal will wait for a ">".  This is to give the host computer time to save data.  In response "Enter transmision speed", enter an integer between 0 and 9 with 0 being fastest and 9 being slowest.  Diferent hosts can accept data at different rates. If you answer yes to the prompt "Open & close recievers buffers?" the smart terminal will open the buffer of the computer on the other end of the phone line.  This is good if you wand to send a file to another smart terminal program that has the ability of automatic buffer open and close.2.6  HELP PAGE  (H)     The "H" command will print a list of commands in case you forget which letter goes to what command.2.7  CLEAR SCREEN  (L)     The "L" commad clears the screen.  This is for those of you who like to be neat.2.8  PRINTER TOGGLE  (T)     If the printer is off, then this command turns it on.  If the printer is on, this commmand turns it off.  When the printer is on, all data is sent to a printer buffer as well as to the screen.  The printer buffer is simutaniously spooled to the printer at a rate the printer can accept.  This buffer is fairly small, so if you use a very slow printer it could fill up and start loosing data.  If this is the case, you can open the main buffer and save the data to disk.  Later, you can list the file to the printer at your convienence.2.9  EXIT  (E)     The "E" command returns you to the terminal menu.2.10  DOWNLOADING     This isn't a command, but is instead something that Compac is very good at.  To download is to recieve a file from a host computer.  The smart terminal suports ascii download; data is transmited as straight ascii (see file transfer for other protocols).  When you download a file, generaly the host will automaticly open your buffer, send the data, and close the buffer.  You then save the buffer to disk ("F" command). The host you are downloading from should explain the exact procedure to use.2.11  UPLOADING     This isn't a command either, but is the exact opposite of downloading.  To upload is to send a file to someone.  The smart terminal suports ascii uploading3.0  FILE TRANSFER     File transfer is just that--transfering files from one computer to another.  The file can be anything: a machine language game, a basic program, or just a text file.     The previously mensioned Downloading and Uploading are file transfer.  Downloading is recieving a file and Uploading is sending a file, but the above protocol (the format used ti send a file) was ascii.  A file is sent as straight text with machine language programs being changed to hexadecimal for transmision.  This method is inherintly bad for three reasons: its slow, there is no error checking, and the size of the file that can be transmited is limited to the buffer size.  The reason it is included is that many BBS suport it, and it is use full in some aplications.     For serious file transfer, compac suports three other protocols: Xmodem, DFT(tm), and Exchange.  Each of these reads data from the disk, and then sends it a block at time.  After each block, a checksum is used to determine if the transmition was error free.  If the tranmision was not, that block is retransmited intill it is sent correctly.  The lenght of a block for DFT(tm) and Exchange is 256 bytes--xmodem has a block length of 128 bytes.     Xmodem is compatible with modem80, the public domain probrm "Xmodem", and the CP/M modem series of programs.  Dft(tm) is compatible with the program "DFT".  These are both popular protocols.     A new protocol introdueced by compac is "Exchange".  Using this protocol alows you to send and recieve multiple files at the same time.  This allows you to trade programs with someone at half the time required by xmodem and Dft(tm).     Exchange and the procedure menu input multiple files, then display them and give the option "(C)ontinue, (E)xit, or (R)enter a file". "C" will contine the file transfer prosess, (E)xit aborts and returns the file transfer menu, and (R)enter will alow you to re-enter a file name in case you made a mistake.  The filenumber you are reentering can be found by couting the files, starting with the upper-left.
